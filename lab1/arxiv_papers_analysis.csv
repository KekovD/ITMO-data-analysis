order logic. We exploit the capability of this logic to talk about the truth
status of formulae to define a notion of coherence between utterances and
explain how this coherence relation can serve for the construction of AND/OR

coherence relations between utterances and attitudes of dialog participants.
Speech acts prove to be useful for determining dialog segments defined on the
notion of completing expectations of dialog participants. Finally, we sketch

formalism and implemented for use with the XTAG system. This report and the
grammar described herein supersedes the TAG grammar described in an earlier
1995 XTAG technical report. The English grammar described in this report is
based on the TAG formalism which has been extended to include lexicalization,

can be handled is large and includes auxiliaries (including inversion), copula,
raising and small clause constructions, topicalization, relative clauses,
infinitives, gerunds, passives, adjuncts, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO
constructions, noun-noun modifications, extraposition, determiner sequences,
genitives, negation, noun-verb contractions, sentential adjuncts and
imperatives. This technical report corresponds to the XTAG Release 8/31/98. The

the form Pr(a_n | a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}). Stochastic grammars, on the other
hand, are typically used to assign structure to utterances. A language model of
the above form is constructed from such grammars by computing the prefix
probability Sum_{w in Sigma*} Pr(a_1 ... a_n w), where w represents all
possible terminations of the prefix a_1 ... a_n. The main result in this paper
is an algorithm to compute such prefix probabilities given a stochastic Tree
Adjoining Grammar (TAG). The algorithm achieves the required computation in
O(n^6) time. The probability of subderivations that do not derive any words in
the prefix, but contribute structurally to its derivation, are precomputed to
achieve termination. This algorithm enables existing corpus-based estimation
techniques for stochastic TAGs to be used for language modelling.","['Mark-Jan Nederhof', 'Anoop Sarkar', 'Giorgio Satta']",1998-09-18T03:45:45Z,"['prefix', 'probability', 'grammar', 'stochastic', 'a_1', 'a_n', 'algorithm', 'language', 'model', 'prefix probability', 'a_1 a_n', 'adjoining', 'adjoining grammar', 'form', 'language model']"

their ability to compare several derivations for the same string in the
language. An important starting point for the study of such cross-derivational
properties is the notion of _consistency_. The probability model defined by a
probabilistic grammar is said to be _consistent_ if the probabilities assigned
to all the strings in the language sum to one. From the literature on
probabilistic context-free grammars (CFGs), we know precisely the conditions
which ensure that consistency is true for a given CFG. This paper derives the
conditions under which a given probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) can
be shown to be consistent. It gives a simple algorithm for checking consistency
and gives the formal justification for its correctness. The conditions derived
here can be used to ensure that probability models that use TAGs can be checked
for _deficiency_ (i.e. whether any probability mass is assigned to strings that
cannot be generated).",['Anoop Sarkar'],1998-09-18T03:58:57Z,"['probabilistic', 'condition', 'grammar', 'probability', 'consistency', 'language', 'string', 'adjoining', 'adjoining grammar', 'assigned', 'assigned string', 'ensure', 'give', 'given', 'model']"

linguistic properties of unknown words inferred from their surrounding context
by parsing sentences with an HPSG grammar for German. We employ a gradual,
information-based concept of ``unknownness'' providing a uniform treatment for
the range of completely known to maximally unknown lexical entries. ``Unknown''
information is viewed as revisable information, which is either generalizable
or specializable. Updating takes place after parsing, which only requires a
modified lexical lookup. Revisable pieces of information are identified by
grammar-specified declarations which provide access paths into the parse
feature structure. The updating mechanism revises the corresponding places in
the lexical feature structures iff the context actually provides new
information. For revising generalizable information, type union is required. A

eliminate run-time optimization. It produces a finite-state oracle that
efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter's search space. As a
byproduct, unknown words can be analyzed without special mechanisms. Unlike
pure finite-state transducer approaches, this hybrid setup allows for more

intercoder reliability study was performed, showing that naive annotators can
reliably perform the targeted annotations. A fully automatic system has been
developed and evaluated on unseen test data, with good results on both data
sets. We adopt a pure realization of a recency-based focus model to identify
precisely when it is and is not adequate for the task being addressed. In
addition to system results, an in-depth evaluation of the model itself is

obtaining a broad coverage grammar: one can simply read the grammar off the
parse trees in the treebank. While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a
square-root rate of growth of the rule set with corpus size suggests that the
derived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would
be required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit. However,
we offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of
structures within the treebank. This hypothesis is explored by applying an
algorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules --
rules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules. The size of the
resulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full
treebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit. However, such a compacted
grammar does not yield very good performance figures. A version of the
compaction algorithm taking rule probabilities into account is proposed, which
is argued to be more linguistically motivated. Combined with simple
thresholding, this method can be used to give a 58% reduction in grammar size
without significant change in parsing performance, and can produce a 69%
reduction with some gain in recall, but a loss in precision.","['Alexander Krotov', 'Mark Hepple', 'Robert Gaizauskas', 'Yorick Wilks']",1999-01-31T18:57:45Z,"['grammar', 'rule', 'treebank', 'size', 'treebank grammar', 'algorithm', 'approach', 'compacted', 'compacted grammar', 'complete', 'derived', 'derived grammar', 'grammar one', 'however', 'limit']"

traditional, but implausible and discredited, view of the lexicon on which it
is effectively empty of content, a view that stands in the long line of
explaining word meaning (a) by ostension and then (b) explaining it by means of
a vacuous symbol in a lexicon, often the word itself after typographic
transmogrification. (a) and (b) both share the wrong belief that to a word must
correspond a simple entity that is its meaning. I then turn to the semantic
rules that Pustejovsky uses and argue first that, although they have novel
features, they are in a well-established Artificial Intelligence tradition of
explaining meaning by reference to structures that mention other structures
assigned to words that may occur in close proximity to the first. It is argued
that Fodor and Lepore's view that there cannot be such rules is without
foundation, and indeed systems using such rules have proved their practical
worth in computational systems. Their justification descends from line of
argument, whose high points were probably Wittgenstein and Quine that meaning
is not to be understood by simple links to the world, ostensive or otherwise,

are belief modelling and speech act processing. Belief modelling is the
development of techniques to represent the mental attitudes of a dialogue
participant. The latter approach, speech act processing, based on speech act

are modelled as steps in a plan where understanding an utterance involves
deriving the complete plan a speaker is attempting to achieve. However,
previous speech act based approaches have been limited by a reliance upon
relatively simplistic belief modelling techniques and their relationship to
planning and plan recognition. In particular, such techniques assume
precomputed nested belief structures. In this paper, we will present an
approach to speech act processing based on novel belief modelling techniques

consists of abstracting over the initial finite set of templates to define
higher level templates, where bilingual equivalences are defined in terms of
correspondences involving phrasal categories. Phrasal templates are then mapped
onto sets of lexical templates with the aid of grammars. In this way an
infinite set of lexical templates is recursively defined. New LTRs are created
by parsing input words, matching a template at the phrasal level and using the
corresponding lexical categories to instantiate the lexical template. The
definition of an infinite set of templates enables the automatic creation of
LTRs for multi-word, non-compositional word equivalences of any cardinality.","['Davide Turcato', 'Paul McFetridge', 'Fred Popowich', 'Janine Toole']",1999-07-09T22:39:52Z,"['template', 'lexical', 'ltrs', 'word', 'set', 'method', 'using', 'category', 'equivalence', 'lexical template', 'new', 'new ltrs', 'phrasal', 'rule', 'set template']"

acceptance of constraint-based analyses of prosodic morphology phenomena such
as truncation, infixation, floating morphemes and reduplication. Of these,
reduplication is particularly challenging for state-of-the-art computational
morphology, since it involves copying of some part of a phonological string. In
this paper I argue for certain extensions to the one-level model of phonology
and morphology (Bird & Ellison 1994) to cover the computational aspects of
prosodic morphology using finite-state methods. In a nutshell, enriched lexical
representations provide additional automaton arcs to repeat or skip sounds and
also to allow insertion of additional material. A kind of resource
consciousness is introduced to control this additional freedom, distinguishing
between producer and consumer arcs. The non-finite-state copying aspect of
reduplication is mapped to automata intersection, itself a non-finite-state
operation. Bounded local optimization prunes certain automaton arcs that fail
to contribute to linguistic optimisation criteria. The paper then presents
implemented case studies of Ulwa construct state infixation, German
hypocoristic truncation and Tagalog over-applying reduplication that illustrate
the expressive power of this approach, before its merits and limitations are
discussed and possible extensions are sketched. I conclude that the one-level

they usually have a more specific goal in mind. Sometimes this goal is covering
a corpus; sometimes the developers have theoretical ideas they wish to
investigate; most often, work is driven by a combination of these two main
types of goal. What tends to happen after a while is that the community of
people working with the grammar starts thinking of some phenomena as
``central'', and makes serious efforts to deal with them; other phenomena are
labelled ``marginal'', and ignored. Before long, the distinction between
``central'' and ``marginal'' becomes so ingrained that it is automatic, and
people virtually stop thinking about the ``marginal'' phenomena. In practice,
the only way to bring the marginal things back into focus is to look at what
other people are doing and compare it with one's own work. In this paper, we
will take two large grammars, XTAG and the CLE, and examine each of them from
the other's point of view. We will find in both cases not only that important
things are missing, but that the perspective offered by the other grammar
suggests simple and practical ways of filling in the holes. It turns out that
there is a pleasing symmetry to the picture. XTAG has a very good treatment of
complement structure, which the CLE to some extent lacks; conversely, the CLE
offers a powerful and general account of adjuncts, which the XTAG grammar does
not fully duplicate. If we examine the way in which each grammar does the thing
it is good at, we find that the relevant methods are quite easy to port to the
other framework, and in fact only involve generalization and systematization of
existing mechanisms.","['Beth Ann Hockey', 'Manny Rayner', 'Frankie James']",2000-06-09T20:49:03Z,"['grammar', 'cle', 'marginal', 'people', 'xtag', 'goal', 'phenomenon', 'thing', 'way', 'central', 'doe', 'examine', 'find', 'good', 'grammar doe']"

http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0006023v2,"Dialogue Act Modeling for Automatic Tagging and Recognition of
  Conversational Speech","We describe a statistical approach for modeling dialogue acts in
conversational speech, i.e., speech-act-like units such as Statement, Question,
Backchannel, Agreement, Disagreement, and Apology. Our model detects and
predicts dialogue acts based on lexical, collocational, and prosodic cues, as
well as on the discourse coherence of the dialogue act sequence. The dialogue
model is based on treating the discourse structure of a conversation as a
hidden Markov model and the individual dialogue acts as observations emanating
from the model states. Constraints on the likely sequence of dialogue acts are
modeled via a dialogue act n-gram. The statistical dialogue grammar is combined
with word n-grams, decision trees, and neural networks modeling the
idiosyncratic lexical and prosodic manifestations of each dialogue act. We
develop a probabilistic integration of speech recognition with dialogue
modeling, to improve both speech recognition and dialogue act classification
accuracy. Models are trained and evaluated using a large hand-labeled database
of 1,155 conversations from the Switchboard corpus of spontaneous
human-to-human telephone speech. We achieved good dialogue act labeling
accuracy (65% based on errorful, automatically recognized words and prosody,
and 71% based on word transcripts, compared to a chance baseline accuracy of
35% and human accuracy of 84%) and a small reduction in word recognition error.","['A. Stolcke', 'K. Ries', 'N. Coccaro', 'E. Shriberg', 'R. Bates', 'D. Jurafsky', 'P. Taylor', 'R. Martin', 'C.

  Conversational Speech?","Identifying whether an utterance is a statement, question, greeting, and so
forth is integral to effective automatic understanding of natural dialog.
Little is known, however, about how such dialog acts (DAs) can be automatically
classified in truly natural conversation. This study asks whether current
approaches, which use mainly word information, could be improved by adding
prosodic information. The study is based on more than 1000 conversations from
the Switchboard corpus. DAs were hand-annotated, and prosodic features
(duration, pause, F0, energy, and speaking rate) were automatically extracted
for each DA. In training, decision trees based on these features were inferred;
trees were then applied to unseen test data to evaluate performance.
Performance was evaluated for prosody models alone, and after combining the
prosody models with word information -- either from true words or from the
output of an automatic speech recognizer. For an overall classification task,
as well as three subtasks, prosody made significant contributions to
classification. Feature-specific analyses further revealed that although
canonical features (such as F0 for questions) were important, less obvious
features could compensate if canonical features were removed. Finally, in each
task, integrating the prosodic model with a DA-specific statistical language
model improved performance over that of the language model alone, especially
for the case of recognized words. Results suggest that DAs are redundantly
marked in natural conversation, and that a variety of automatically extractable
prosodic features could aid dialog processing in speech applications.","['E. Shriberg', 'R. Bates', 'A. Stolcke', 'P. Taylor', 'D. Jurafsky', 'K. Ries', 'N. Coccaro', 'R. Martin', 'M. Meteer', 'C.

developed, based on the relative entropy between the original and the pruned

N-gram can be computed exactly and efficiently for backoff models. The relative
entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training set
perplexity. This leads to a simple pruning criterion whereby all N-grams that
change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model.
Experiments show that a production-quality Hub4 LM can be reduced to 26% its
original size without increasing recognition error. We also compare the
approach to a heuristic pruning criterion by Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), and
show that their approach can be interpreted as an approximation to the relative
entropy criterion. Experimentally, both approaches select similar sets of
N-grams (about 85% overlap), with the exact relative entropy criterion giving
marginally better performance.",['A. Stolcke'],2000-06-11T18:20:20Z,"['entropy', 'relative', 'criterion', 'model', 'pruning', 'relative entropy', 'gram', 'approach', 'backoff', 'backoff language', 'based', 'change', 'entropy criterion', 'language', 'language model']"

topic detection, or browsing/playback is to segment the input into sentence and
topic units. Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically
present for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in
spoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from
the timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and
hidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based
approaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and
Switchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with,
or better than, word-based statistical language models -- for both true and
automatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves
comparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no
hand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a
significant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination
of prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic
models capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the
literature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause
and pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas
pause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.","['E. Shriberg', 'A. Stolcke', 'D. Hakkani-Tur', 'G.

  Quantitative and Statistical Inference in Constraint-Based Natural Language
  Processing","In this thesis, we present two approaches to a rigorous mathematical and
algorithmic foundation of quantitative and statistical inference in
constraint-based natural language processing. The first approach, called
quantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical
framework, and presents a sound and complete system of quantitative inference
for definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines
a rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective
weights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The
second approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces
a log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic
program and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and
properties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., unparsed data. The
possibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties of
the log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate
parameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary
context-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these
ideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the
correct parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we address the
problem of computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in
the inference task and present various techniques to approximately solve this
task. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching for

multisyllable approach in which multiple syllable classes are defined that
reflect phonotactically idiosyncratic syllable subcategories. A new
finite-state formalism, OFS Modelling, is used as a tool for encoding,
automatically constructing and generalising phonotactic descriptions.
Language-independent prototype models are constructed which are instantiated on
the basis of data sets of phonological strings, and generalised with a
clustering algorithm. The resulting approach enables the automatic construction
of phonotactic models that encode arbitrarily close approximations of a
language's set of attested phonological forms. The approach is applied to the
construction of multi-syllable word-level phonotactic models for German,
English and Dutch.",['Anja Belz'],2001-02-22T21:05:01Z,"['approach', 'phonotactic', 'model', 'syllable', 'phonological', 'phonotactic model', 'constructing', 'construction', 'description', 'language', 'modelling', 'multi', 'multi syllable', 'set', 'algorithm']"

computational model of Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993), employs
a finite state machine to represent the set of active candidates at each stage
of an Optimality Theoretic derivation, as well as weighted finite state
machines to represent the constraints themselves. For some purposes, however,
it would be convenient if the set of candidates were limited by some set of
criteria capable of being described only in a higher-level grammar formalism,
such as a Context Free Grammar, a Context Sensitive Grammar, or a Multiple
Context Free Grammar (Seki et al., 1991). Examples include reduplication and
phrasal stress models. Here we introduce a mechanism for OTP-like Optimality
Theory in which the constraints remain weighted finite state machines, but sets
of candidates are represented by higher-level grammars. In particular, we use
multiple context-free grammars to model reduplication in the manner of
Correspondence Theory (McCarthy and Prince, 1995), and develop an extended

Language Generation (NLG), such as referring expression generation, lexical
choice, and aggregation, problems in which a generator must bridge underlying
domain-specific representations and general linguistic representations. In this
paper, we describe a uniform approach to microplanning based on declarative
representations of a generator's communicative intent. These representations
describe the results of NLG: communicative intent associates the concrete
linguistic structure planned by the generator with inferences that show how the
meaning of that structure communicates needed information about some
application domain in the current discourse context. Our approach, implemented
in the SPUD (sentence planning using description) microplanner, uses the
lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar formalism (LTAG) to connect structure to
meaning and uses modal logic programming to connect meaning to context. At the
same time, communicative intent representations provide a resource for the
process of NLG. Using representations of communicative intent, a generator can
augment the syntax, semantics and pragmatics of an incomplete sentence
simultaneously, and can assess its progress on the various problems of
microplanning incrementally. The declarative formulation of communicative
intent translates into a well-defined methodology for designing grammatical and
conceptual resources which the generator can use to achieve desired

natural language processing (NLP) tasks and is thus a reliable method of
getting a high-level of performance when building corpus-based NLP systems.
However there is a bottleneck in MBL whereby any novel testing item has to be
compared against all the training items in memory base. For this reason there
has been some interest in various forms of memory editing whereby some method
of selecting a subset of the memory base is employed to reduce the number of
comparisons. This paper investigates the use of a modified self-organising map
(SOM) to select a subset of the memory items for comparison. This method
involves reducing the number of comparisons to a value proportional to the

natural language processing problems. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
on many natural language processing tasks and does not overtrain easily.
However, it does have a serious drawback: the training time is often
intorelably long, especially on the large corpora which are often used in NLP.
In this paper, we present a novel and realistic method for speeding up the
training time of a transformation-based learner without sacrificing
performance. The paper compares and contrasts the training time needed and
performance achieved by our modified learner with two other systems: a standard
transformation-based learner, and the ICA system \cite{hepple00:tbl}. The
results of these experiments show that our system is able to achieve a
significant improvement in training time while still achieving the same
performance as a standard transformation-based learner. This is a valuable

simultaneously on all fields. The motivation for constructing such a system
stems from the observation that many tasks in natural language processing are
naturally composed of multiple subtasks which need to be resolved
simultaneously; also tasks usually learned in isolation can possibly benefit
from being learned in a joint framework, as the signals for the extra tasks
usually constitute inductive bias.
  The proposed algorithm is evaluated in two experiments: in one, the system is
used to jointly predict the part-of-speech and text chunks/baseNP chunks of an
English corpus; and in the second it is used to learn the joint prediction of
word segment boundaries and part-of-speech tagging for Chinese. The results
show that the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks does achieve an
improvement in each task upon training the same tasks sequentially. The

change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two
maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and
the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads
to fewer non-zero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving
speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It
also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be
used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural
networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as

part-of-speech (POS) disambiguation. Compared to an HMM, this FST cascade has
the advantage of significantly higher processing speed, but at the cost of
slightly lower accuracy. Applications such as Information Retrieval, where the
speed can be more important than accuracy, could benefit from this approach.
  In the process of tagging, we first assign every word a unique ambiguity
class c_i that can be looked up in a lexicon encoded by a sequential FST. Every
c_i is denoted by a single symbol, e.g. [ADJ_NOUN], although it represents a
set of alternative tags that a given word can occur with. The sequence of the
c_i of all words of one sentence is the input to our FST cascade. It is mapped
by T1, from left to right, to a sequence of reduced ambiguity classes r_i.
Every r_i is denoted by a single symbol, although it represents a set of
alternative tags. Intuitively, T1 eliminates the less likely tags from c_i,
thus creating r_i. Finally, T2 maps the sequence of r_i, from right to left, to
a sequence of single POS tags t_i. Intuitively, T2 selects the most likely t_i
from every r_i.
  The probabilities of all t_i, r_i, and c_i are used only at compile time, not
at run time. They do not (directly) occur in the FSTs, but are ""implicitly

Japanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.
Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient

designed to probe the network of cultural and perceptual associations that
humans naturally develop as we live, embodied and embedded in the world. In
this paper, I show how it is possible for a disembodied computer to answer
subcognitive questions appropriately, contrary to French's claim. My approach
to answering subcognitive questions is to use statistical information extracted
from a very large collection of text. In particular, I show how it is possible
to answer a sample of subcognitive questions taken from French, by issuing
queries to a search engine that indexes about 350 million Web pages. This
simple algorithm may shed light on the nature of human (sub-) cognition, but
the scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating that French is mistaken: a
disembodied computer can answer subcognitive questions.",['Peter D.

  Information","In this paper we describe an algorithm for aligning sentences with their
translations in a bilingual corpus using lexical information of the languages.
Existing efficient algorithms ignore word identities and consider only the
sentence lengths (Brown, 1991; Gale and Church, 1993). For a sentence in the
source language text, the proposed algorithm picks the most likely translation
from the target language text using lexical information and certain heuristics.
It does not do statistical analysis using sentence lengths. The algorithm is
language independent. It also aids in detecting addition and deletion of text
in translations. The algorithm gives comparable results with the existing
algorithms in most of the cases while it does better in cases where statistical
algorithms do not give good results.","['Akshar Bharati', 'V. Sriram', 'A. Vamshi Krishna', 'Rajeev Sangal', 'S. M.

this scale function being determined by previously encountered cepstra from

it in the following sense: it is unaffected if the time series is transformed
by any time-independent invertible distortion. Because a linear channel with
stationary noise and impulse response transforms cepstra in this way, the new
technique can be used to remove the channel dependence of a cepstral time
series. In experiments, the method achieved greater channel-independence than
cepstral mean normalization, and it was comparable to the combination of
cepstral mean normalization and spectral subtraction, despite the fact that no
measurements of channel noise or reverberations were required (unlike spectral
subtraction).",['David N. Levin'],2003-04-10T22:25:01Z,"['channel', 'time', 'cepstral', 'series', 'time series', 'normalization', 'cepstra', 'cepstral mean', 'cepstral time', 'form', 'function', 'independent', 'linear', 'mean', 'mean normalization']"

k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (kNN).In the classification process, k nearest
documents to the test one in the training set are determined firstly. Then, the
predication can be made according to the category distribution among these k
nearest neighbors. Generally speaking, the class distribution in the training
set is uneven. Some classes may have more samples than others. Therefore, the
system performance is very sensitive to the choice of the parameter k. And it
is very likely that a fixed k value will result in a bias on large categories.
To deal with these problems, we propose an improved kNN algorithm, which uses
different numbers of nearest neighbors for different categories, rather than a
fixed number across all categories. More samples (nearest neighbors) will be
used for deciding whether a test document should be classified to a category,
which has more samples in the training set. Preliminary experiments on Chinese
text categorization show that our method is less sensitive to the parameter k
than the traditional one, and it can properly classify documents belonging to
smaller classes with a large k. The method is promising for some cases, where
estimating the parameter k via cross-validation is not allowed.","['Baoli Li', 'Shiwen Yu', 'Qin Lu']",2003-06-16T13:54:03Z,"['nearest', 'category', 'nearest neighbor', 'neighbor', 'parameter', 'algorithm', 'categorization', 'class', 'document', 'sample', 'set', 'text', 'text categorization', 'training', 'training set']"

constraints. Knowledge of the phonetic caracteristics of French vowels enable
the derivation of reasonable articulatory domains in the space of Maeda
parameters: given the formants frequencies (F1,F2,F3) of a speech sample, and
thus the vowel identity, an ""ideal"" articulatory domain can be derived. The
space of formants frequencies is partitioned into vowels, using either
speaker-specific data or generic information on formants. Then, to each
articulatory vector can be associated a phonetic score varying with the
distance to the ""ideal domain"" associated with the corresponding vowel.
Inversion experiments were conducted on isolated vowels and vowel-to-vowel
transitions. Articulatory parameters were compared with those obtained without
using these constraints and those measured from X-ray data.","['Blaise Potard', 'Yves Laprie']",2005-11-21T14:50:52Z,"['articulatory', 'vowel', 'inversion', 'phonetic', 'constraint', 'domain', 'formants', 'using', 'acoustic', 'acoustic articulatory', 'articulatory domain', 'articulatory inversion', 'associated', 'data', 'formants frequency']"

network analyses, which is inspired by the recent surge of interests in network
studies of many real-world systems. Children's and care-takers' speech data
from a longitudinal study are represented as a series of networks, word forms
being taken as nodes and collocation of words as links. Measures on the
properties of the networks, such as size, connectivity, hub and authority
analyses, etc., allow us to make quantitative comparison so as to reveal
different paths of development. For example, the asynchrony of development in
network size and average degree suggests that children cannot be simply
classified as early talkers or late talkers by one or two measures. Children
follow different paths in a multi-dimensional space. They may develop faster in
one dimension but slower in another dimension. The network approach requires
little preprocessing of words and analyses on sentence structures, and the
characteristics of words and their usage emerge from the network and are
independent of any grammatical presumptions. We show that the change of the two
articles ""the"" and ""a"" in their roles as important nodes in the network
reflects the progress of children's syntactic development: the two articles
often start in children's networks as hubs and later shift to authorities,
while they are authorities constantly in the adult's networks. The network
analyses provide a new approach to study language development, and at the same
time language development also presents a rich area for network theories to
explore.","['J-Y Ke', 'Y. Yao']",2006-01-04T18:33:53Z,"['network', 'development', 'child', 'analysis', 'language', 'language development', 'word', 'approach', 'authority', 'measure', 'study', 'two', 'article', 'development network', 'different']"

http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0606096v1,Building a resource for studying translation shifts,"This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach which brings together the
fields of corpus linguistics and translation studies. It presents ongoing work
on the creation of a corpus resource in which translation shifts are explicitly
annotated. Translation shifts denote departures from formal correspondence
between source and target text, i.e. deviations that have occurred during the
translation process. A resource in which such shifts are annotated in a
systematic way will make it possible to study those phenomena that need to be
addressed if machine translation output is to resemble human translation. The
resource described in this paper contains English source texts (parliamentary
proceedings) and their German translations. The shift annotation is based on
predicate-argument structures and proceeds in two steps: first, predicates and
their arguments are annotated monolingually in a straightforward manner. Then,
the corresponding English and German predicates and arguments are aligned with
each other. Whenever a shift - mainly grammatical or semantic -has occurred,
the alignment is tagged accordingly.",['Lea Cyrus'],2006-06-22T13:26:52Z,"['translation', 'shift', 'resource', 'translation shift', 'annotated', 'argument', 'predicate', 'predicate argument', 'corpus', 'english', 'german', 'occurred', 'paper', 'source', 'study']"

development of network theories. There are two directions of exploration. One
is to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks
can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or
syntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit
small-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to
study networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the
linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks
also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by
random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language
change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or
regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures
may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of
simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate
the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for
modeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which
exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which
type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some
preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.",['Jinyun KE'],2007-01-22T00:45:31Z,"['network', 'language', 'social', 'social network', 'model', 'modeling', 'structure', 'study', 'type', 'change', 'choosing', 'diffusion', 'direction', 'direction exploration', 'dynamic']"

level, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be

intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known)
network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use
and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying
grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to
build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed
to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of
structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria
assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic
relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that
enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build
a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard

Document Planning phase of a typical NLG architecture, it can be the case that
the number of messages contained in a grid is very large, exceeding thus the

annotation of written Korean text. Korean is an agglutinative language. Our
annotator is designed to process text before the operation of a syntactic
parser. In its present state, it annotates one-stem words only. The output is a
graph of morphemes annotated with accurate linguistic information. The
granularity of the tagset is 3 to 5 times higher than usual tagsets. A
comparison with a reference annotated corpus showed that it achieves 89% recall
without any corpus training. The language resources used by the system are
lexicons of stems, transducers of suffixes and transducers of generation of
allomorphs. All can be easily updated, which allows users to control the
evolution of the performances of the system. It has been claimed that
morphological annotation of Korean text could only be performed by a
morphological analysis module accessing a lexicon of morphemes. We show that it
can also be performed directly with a lexicon of words and without applying
morphological rules at annotation time, which speeds up annotation to 1,210
word/s. The lexicon of words is obtained from the maintainable language
resources through a fully automated compilation process.","['Ivan Berlocher', 'Hyun-Gue Huh', 'Eric Laporte', 'Jee-Sun Nam']",2007-11-21T16:47:57Z,"['annotation', 'morphological', 'korean', 'lexicon', 'resource', 'word', 'language', 'morphological annotation', 'text', 'annotated', 'annotation korean', 'corpus', 'directly', 'korean text', 'language resource']"

Using co-occurrence matrices, we split filtering into two steps. The list of
valid arguments is first determined for each verb, whereas the pattern

http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3017v1,Statistical analysis of the Indus script using $n$-grams,"The Indus script is one of the major undeciphered scripts of the ancient
world. The small size of the corpus, the absence of bilingual texts, and the
lack of definite knowledge of the underlying language has frustrated efforts at
decipherment since the discovery of the remains of the Indus civilisation.
Recently, some researchers have questioned the premise that the Indus script
encodes spoken language. Building on previous statistical approaches, we apply
the tools of statistical language processing, specifically $n$-gram Markov
chains, to analyse the Indus script for syntax. Our main results are that the
script has well-defined signs which begin and end texts, that there is
directionality and strong correlations in the sign order, and that there are
groups of signs which appear to have identical syntactic function. All these
require no {\it a priori} suppositions regarding the syntactic or semantic
content of the signs, but follow directly from the statistical analysis. Using
information theoretic measures, we find the information in the script to be
intermediate between that of a completely random and a completely fixed
ordering of signs. Our study reveals that the Indus script is a structured sign
system showing features of a formal language, but, at present, cannot
conclusively establish that it encodes {\it natural} language. Our $n$-gram
Markov model is useful for predicting signs which are missing or illegible in a
corpus of Indus texts. This work forms the basis for the development of a
stochastic grammar which can be used to explore the syntax of the Indus script
in greater detail.","['Nisha Yadav', 'Hrishikesh Joglekar', 'Rajesh P. N. Rao', 'M. N. Vahia', 'Iravatham Mahadevan', 'R.

  Summarization","Current research in automatic single document summarization is dominated by
two effective, yet naive approaches: summarization by sentence extraction, and
headline generation via bag-of-words models. While successful in some tasks,
neither of these models is able to adequately capture the large set of
linguistic devices utilized by humans when they produce summaries. One possible
explanation for the widespread use of these models is that good techniques have
been developed to extract appropriate training data for them from existing
document/abstract and document/headline corpora. We believe that future
progress in automatic summarization will be driven both by the development of
more sophisticated, linguistically informed models, as well as a more effective
leveraging of document/abstract corpora. In order to open the doors to
simultaneously achieving both of these goals, we have developed techniques for
automatically producing word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignments between
documents and their human-written abstracts. These alignments make explicit the
correspondences that exist in such document/abstract pairs, and create a
potentially rich data source from which complex summarization algorithms may
learn. This paper describes experiments we have carried out to analyze the
ability of humans to perform such alignments, and based on these analyses, we
describe experiments for creating them automatically. Our model for the
alignment task is based on an extension of the standard hidden Markov model,
and learns to create alignments in a completely unsupervised fashion. We
describe our model in detail and present experimental results that show that
our model is able to learn to reliably identify word- and phrase-level

Segmentation of words into individual letters has been one of the major

performance difference obtained in applying an ANN-based dynamic segmentation
algorithm compared to projection- based static segmentation. The algorithm
involves, first training of an ANN with individual handwritten characters
recorded from different individuals. Handwritten sentences are separated out
from text using a static segmentation method. From the segmented line,
individual characters are separated out by first over segmenting the entire
line. Each of the segments thus obtained, next, is fed to the trained ANN. The
point of segmentation at which the ANN recognizes a segment or a combination of
several segments to be similar to a handwritten character, a segmentation
boundary for the character is assumed to exist and segmentation performed. The
segmented character is next compared to the best available match and the
segmentation boundary confirmed.","['Kaustubh Bhattacharyya', 'Kandarpa Kumar Sarma']",2009-11-04T18:32:08Z,"['segmentation', 'character', 'ann', 'handwritten', 'individual', 'segment', 'work', 'based', 'handwritten character', 'recognition', 'text', 'algorithm', 'ann based', 'artificial', 'assamese']"

  MMI","Maximum mutual information (MMI) is a model selection criterion used for
hidden Markov model (HMM) parameter estimation that was developed more than
twenty years ago as a discriminative alternative to the maximum likelihood
criterion for HMM-based speech recognition. It has been shown in the speech
recognition literature that parameter estimation using the current MMI
paradigm, lattice-based MMI, consistently outperforms maximum likelihood
estimation, but this is at the expense of undesirable convergence properties.
In particular, recognition performance is sensitive to the number of times that
the iterative MMI estimation algorithm, extended Baum-Welch, is performed. In
fact, too many iterations of extended Baum-Welch will lead to degraded
performance, despite the fact that the MMI criterion improves at each
iteration. This phenomenon is at variance with the analogous behavior of
maximum likelihood estimation -- at least for the HMMs used in speech
recognition -- and it has previously been attributed to `over fitting'. In this
paper, we present an analysis of lattice-based MMI that demonstrates, first of
all, that the asymptotic behavior of lattice-based MMI is much worse than was
previously understood, i.e. it does not appear to converge at all, and, second
of all, that this is not due to `over fitting'. Instead, we demonstrate that
the `over fitting' phenomenon is the result of standard methodology that
exacerbates the poor behavior of two key approximations in the lattice-based
MMI machinery. We also demonstrate that if we modify the standard methodology
to improve the validity of these approximations, then the convergence
properties of lattice-based MMI become benign without sacrificing improvements
to recognition accuracy.",['Steven Wegmann'],2010-02-03T16:06:24Z,"['mmi', 'based', 'based mmi', 'lattice', 'lattice based', 'estimation', 'recognition', 'criterion', 'maximum', 'approximation', 'behavior', 'fitting', 'likelihood', 'maximum likelihood', 'speech']"

  to achieve?","Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to automatic
speech recognition for more than 35 years in spite of the fact that a key HMM
assumption -- the statistical independence of frames -- is obviously violated
by speech data. In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired many attempts to
modify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are better able to take
into account the statistical dependence of frames. However it is fair to say
that in 2010 the HMM is the consensus model of choice for speech recognition
and that HMMs are at the heart of both commercially available products and
contemporary research systems. In this paper we present a preliminary
exploration aimed at understanding how speech data depart from HMMs and what
effect this departure has on the accuracy of HMM-based speech recognition. Our
analysis uses standard diagnostic tools from the field of statistics --
hypothesis testing, simulation and resampling -- which are rarely used in the
field of speech recognition. Our main result, obtained by novel manipulations
of real and resampled data, demonstrates that real data have statistical
dependency and that this dependency is responsible for significant numbers of
recognition errors. We also demonstrate, using simulation and resampling, that
if we `remove' the statistical dependency from data, then the resulting
recognition error rates become negligible. Taken together, these results
suggest that a better understanding of the structure of the statistical
dependency in speech data is a crucial first step towards improving HMM-based
speech recognition.","['Steven Wegmann', 'Larry Gillick']",2010-02-28T19:00:12Z,"['speech', 'recognition', 'data', 'speech recognition', 'statistical', 'dependency', 'hmm', 'hmms', 'model', 'speech data', 'statistical dependency', 'automatic', 'automatic speech', 'based', 'based speech']"

items that change the way inferences are made. Recent work proposed a method
for learning English downward-entailing operators that requires access to a
high-quality collection of 'negative polarity items' (NPIs). However, English
is one of the very few languages for which such a list exists. We propose the
first approach that can be applied to the many languages for which there is no
pre-existing high-precision database of NPIs. As a case study, we apply our
method to Romanian and show that our method yields good results. Also, we
perform a cross-linguistic analysis that suggests interesting connections to
some findings in linguistic typology.","['Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil', 'Lillian Lee']",2010-08-18T20:08:22Z,"['downward', 'downward entailing', 'entailing', 'entailing operator', 'method', 'operator', 'english', 'high', 'inference', 'interesting', 'item', 'language', 'learning', 'linguistic', 'npis']"

dualize the logical vocabulary, Moortgat proposed the Lambek-Grishin calculus

develop a theory of labeled modal tableaux for LG, inspired by the
interpretation of its connectives as binary modal operators in the relational
semantics of Kurtonina and Moortgat. As a linguistic application of our method,
we show that grammars based on LG are context-free through use of an

Top-down parsers have the great advantage of having a certain predictive power

case of Context-Free Grammars, which are already top-down, but these are
difficult to adapt to Minimalist Grammars, which generate sentences bottom-up.
I propose here a way of rewriting Minimalist Grammars as Linear Context-Free
Rewriting Systems, allowing to easily create a top-down parser. This rewriting
allows also to put a probabilistic field on these grammars, which can be used
to accelerate the parser. Finally, I propose a method of refining the

the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of
this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without
a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version
of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no
letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not
know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The
annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and
recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the
rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after
reading a few pages of Annotated English, and can take advantage from that

these problems were due to the complexity, novelty, and poorly understood

people write so differently. This meant in particular that corpus-based KA
approaches suffered because it was impossible to assemble a sizable corpus of
high-quality consistent manually written texts in our domains; and structured

could not get enough information about special and unusual cases to build
robust systems. We believe that such problems are likely to affect many other

technique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on
the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a

presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid
pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence

intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph
representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in first place
in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we

  Dialogue","A fundamental requirement of any task-oriented dialogue system is the ability
to generate object descriptions that refer to objects in the task domain. The
subproblem of content selection for object descriptions in task-oriented
dialogue has been the focus of much previous work and a large number of models
have been proposed. In this paper, we use the annotated COCONUT corpus of
task-oriented design dialogues to develop feature sets based on Dale and
Reiters (1995) incremental model, Brennan and Clarks (1996) conceptual pact
model, and Jordans (2000b) intentional influences model, and use these feature
sets in a machine learning experiment to automatically learn a model of content
selection for object descriptions. Since Dale and Reiters model requires a
representation of discourse structure, the corpus annotations are used to
derive a representation based on Grosz and Sidners (1986) theory of the
intentional structure of discourse, as well as two very simple representations
of discourse structure based purely on recency. We then apply the
rule-induction program RIPPER to train and test the content selection component
of an object description generator on a set of 393 object descriptions from the
corpus. To our knowledge, this is the first reported experiment of a trainable
content selection component for object description generation in dialogue.
Three separate content selection models that are based on the three theoretical
models, all independently achieve accuracies significantly above the majority
class baseline (17%) on unseen test data, with the intentional influences model
(42.4%) performing significantly better than either the incremental model
(30.4%) or the conceptual pact model (28.9%). But the best performing models
combine all the feature sets, achieving accuracies near 60%. Surprisingly, a
simple recency-based representation of discourse structure does as well as one
based on intentional structure. To our knowledge, this is also the first
empirical comparison of a representation of Grosz and Sidners model of
discourse structure with a simpler model for any generation task.","['P. W. Jordan', 'M. A.

Pronunciation by analogy (PbA) is a data-driven method of constructing
pronunciations for novel words from concatenated segments of known words and
their pronunciations. PbA performs relatively well with English and outperforms
several other proposed methods. However, the best published word accuracy of
65.5% (for the 20,000 word NETtalk corpus) suggests there is much room for
improvement in it.
  Previous PbA algorithms have used several different scoring strategies such
as the product of the frequencies of the component pronunciations of the
segments, or the number of different segmentations that yield the same
pronunciation, and different combinations of these methods, to evaluate the
candidate pronunciations. In this article, we instead propose to use a
probabilistically justified scoring rule. We show that this principled approach
alone yields better accuracy (66.21% for the NETtalk corpus) than any
previously published PbA algorithm. Furthermore, combined with certain ad hoc
modifications motivated by earlier algorithms, the performance climbs up to
66.6%, and further improvements are possible by combining this method with

integral role in the application of agreement restrictions between pronouns and
candidates, and as a result, can improve the accuracy of anaphora resolution
systems. In this paper, two methods for animacy identification are proposed and
evaluated using intrinsic and extrinsic measures. The first method is a
rule-based one which uses information about the unique beginners in WordNet to
classify NPs on the basis of their animacy. The second method relies on a
machine learning algorithm which exploits a WordNet enriched with animacy
information for each sense. The effect of word sense disambiguation on the two
methods is also assessed. The intrinsic evaluation reveals that the machine
learning method reaches human levels of performance. The extrinsic evaluation
demonstrates that animacy identification can be beneficial in anaphora

high precision.","['R. J. Evans', 'C. Orasan']",2011-10-10T22:13:24Z,"['animacy', 'method', 'anaphora', 'anaphora resolution', 'animacy identification', 'identification', 'resolution', 'evaluation', 'extrinsic', 'information', 'intrinsic', 'learning', 'machine', 'machine learning', 'sense']"

dialogue systems is the design of the spoken language generation module. This
challenge arises from the need for the generator to adapt to many features of
the dialogue domain, user population, and dialogue context. A promising
approach is trainable generation, which uses general-purpose linguistic
knowledge that is automatically adapted to the features of interest, such as
the application domain, individual user, or user group. In this paper we
present and evaluate a trainable sentence planner for providing restaurant
information in the MATCH dialogue system. We show that trainable sentence
planning can produce complex information presentations whose quality is
comparable to the output of a template-based generator tuned to this domain. We
also show that our method easily supports adapting the sentence planner to
individuals, and that the individualized sentence planners generally perform
better than models trained and tested on a population of individuals. Previous
work has documented and utilized individual preferences for content selection,
but to our knowledge, these results provide the first demonstration of
individual preferences for sentence planning operations, affecting the content
order, discourse structure and sentence structure of system responses. Finally,

processing is materialized by the need to have applications that can
effectively treat the vast mass of information available nowadays on electronic
forms. Among these tools, mainly driven by the necessity of a fast writing in
alignment to the actual daily life speed, our interest is on the writing
auditors. The morphological and syntactic properties of Arabic make it a
difficult language to master, and explain the lack in the processing tools for
that language. Among these properties, we can mention: the complex structure of
the Arabic word, the agglutinative nature, lack of vocalization, the
segmentation of the text, the linguistic richness, etc.","['Riadh Bouslimi', 'Houda Amraoui']",2012-03-08T13:28:03Z,"['language', 'arabic', 'processing', 'tool', 'among', 'application', 'lack', 'natural', 'natural language', 'property', 'study', 'writing', 'actual', 'actual daily', 'agglutinative']"

  Learning Techniques","In this paper, a supervised learning technique for extracting keyphrases of
Arabic documents is presented. The extractor is supplied with linguistic
knowledge to enhance its efficiency instead of relying only on statistical
information such as term frequency and distance. During analysis, an annotated
Arabic corpus is used to extract the required lexical features of the document
words. The knowledge also includes syntactic rules based on part of speech tags

the abstract form of Arabic words is used instead of its stem form to represent
the candidate terms. The Abstract form hides most of the inflections found in
Arabic words. The paper introduces new features of keyphrases based on
linguistic knowledge, to capture titles and subtitles of a document. A simple
ANOVA test is used to evaluate the validity of selected features. Then, the
learning model is built using the LDA - Linear Discriminant Analysis - and
training documents. Although, the presented system is trained using documents
in the IT domain, experiments carried out show that it has a significantly
better performance than the existing Arabic extractor systems, where precision

and used extensively by computational linguists ever since it was released.
Inspired by WordNet's success, we propose as an alternative a similar resource,
based on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and

  Peter Mark Roget published his first Thesaurus over 150 years ago. Countless
writers, orators and students of the English language have used it.
Computational linguists have employed Roget's for almost 50 years in Natural
Language Processing, however hesitated in accepting Roget's Thesaurus because a
proper machine tractable version was not available.
  This dissertation presents an implementation of a machine-tractable version
of the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus - the first implementation of
its kind to use an entire current edition. It explains the steps necessary for
taking a machine-readable file and transforming it into a tractable system.
This involves converting the lexical material into a format that can be more
easily exploited, identifying data structures and designing classes to
computerize the Thesaurus. Roget's organization is studied in detail and
contrasted with WordNet's.
  We show two applications of the computerized Thesaurus: computing semantic
similarity between words and phrases, and building lexical chains in a text.
The experiments are performed using well-known benchmarks and the results are
compared to those of other systems that use Roget's, WordNet and statistical
techniques. Roget's has turned out to be an excellent resource for measuring
semantic similarity; lexical chains are easily built but more difficult to
evaluate. We also explain ways in which Roget's Thesaurus and WordNet can be
combined.",['Mario Jarmasz'],2012-03-31T21:53:56Z,"['roget', 'thesaurus', 'lexical', 'roget thesaurus', 'wordnet', 'edition', 'language', 'machine', 'resource', 'tractable', '1987', '1987 penguin', 'chain', 'computational', 'computational linguist']"

contextual error correction. Experiments conducted on a set of text articles

http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6364v1,"A Corpus-based Evaluation of a Domain-specific Text to Knowledge Mapping
  Prototype","The aim of this paper is to evaluate a Text to Knowledge Mapping (TKM)
Prototype. The prototype is domain-specific, the purpose of which is to map
instructional text onto a knowledge domain. The context of the knowledge domain
is DC electrical circuit. During development, the prototype has been tested
with a limited data set from the domain. The prototype reached a stage where it
needs to be evaluated with a representative linguistic data set called corpus.
A corpus is a collection of text drawn from typical sources which can be used
as a test data set to evaluate NLP systems. As there is no available corpus for
the domain, we developed and annotated a representative corpus. The evaluation
of the prototype considers two of its major components- lexical components and
knowledge model. Evaluation on lexical components enriches the lexical
resources of the prototype like vocabulary and grammar structures. This leads
the prototype to parse a reasonable amount of sentences in the corpus. While
dealing with the lexicon was straight forward, the identification and
extraction of appropriate semantic relations was much more involved. It was
necessary, therefore, to manually develop a conceptual structure for the domain
to formulate a domain-specific framework of semantic relations. The framework
of semantic relationsthat has resulted from this study consisted of 55
relations, out of which 42 have inverse relations. We also conducted rhetorical
analysis on the corpus to prove its representativeness in conveying semantic.
Finally, we conducted a topical and discourse analysis on the corpus to analyze
the coverage of discourse by the prototype.","['Rushdi Shams', 'Adel Elsayed', 'Quazi Mah-Zereen Akter']",2012-04-28T03:52:21Z,"['prototype', 'corpus', 'domain', 'knowledge', 'relation', 'semantic', 'text', 'component', 'data', 'data set', 'domain specific', 'evaluation', 'lexical', 'set', 'specific']"

powerful syntactic way of analysing the detailed meaning of various sentences,

yellow', the introduction of an appropriate noun, here 'colour', specifies
which quality the adjective describes. In some other adjectival sentences with
an appropriate noun, that noun plays the same part as 'colour' and seems to be
relevant to the description of the adjective. These appropriate nouns can
usually be used in elementary sentences like 'The leather had some colour', but
in many cases they have a more or less obligatory modifier. For example, you
can hardly mention that an object has a colour without qualifying that colour
at all. About 300 French nouns are appropriate in at least one adjectival
sentence and have an obligatory modifier. They enter in a number of sentence
structures related by several syntactic transformations. The appropriateness of
the noun and the fact that the modifier is obligatory are reflected in these
transformations. The description of these syntactic phenomena provides a basis
for a classification of these nouns. It also concerns the lexical properties of
thousands of predicative adjectives, and in particular the relations between
the sentence without the noun : 'The leather was yellow' and the adjectival

http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4567v2,Gender identity and lexical variation in social media,"We present a study of the relationship between gender, linguistic style, and
social networks, using a novel corpus of 14,000 Twitter users. Prior
quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male
binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we
find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical
interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of
linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level
language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of
the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work
has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy
population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a
statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each
individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match
the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks
that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in
general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender
language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a
new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves
relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.","['David Bamman', 'Jacob Eisenstein', 'Tyler Schnoebelen']",2012-10-16T20:22:56Z,"['gender', 'social', 'individual', 'language', 'style', 'classifier', 'linguistic', 'network', 'social network', 'cluster', 'corpus', 'dataset', 'find', 'individual whose', 'level']"

articulation. Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where
the points intersect. The top radical represents manner of articulation where
the bottom represents place of articulation. A horizontal line running through
the middle of the bottom radical represents voicing. For vowels, place of
articulation is located on a grid that represents the position of the tongue in
the mouth. This grid is similar to that of the IPA vowel chart (International

trapezoid representing the vocal apparatus is on a slight tilt. Place of
articulation for a vowel is represented by a breakout figure from the grid.

  Domain","Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) and machine translation (MT)
resources, such as dictionaries and parallel corpora, are scarce and hard to
come by for special domains. Besides, these resources are just limited to a few
languages, such as English, French, and Spanish and so on. So, obtaining
comparable corpora automatically for such domains could be an answer to this
problem effectively. Comparable corpora, that the subcorpora are not
translations of each other, can be easily obtained from web. Therefore,
building and using comparable corpora is often a more feasible option in
multilingual information processing. Comparability metrics is one of key issues
in the field of building and using comparable corpus. Currently, there is no
widely accepted definition or metrics method of corpus comparability. In fact,
Different definitions or metrics methods of comparability might be given to
suit various tasks about natural language processing. A new comparability,
namely, termhood-based metrics, oriented to the task of bilingual terminology
extraction, is proposed in this paper. In this method, words are ranked by
termhood not frequency, and then the cosine similarities, calculated based on
the ranking lists of word termhood, is used as comparability. Experiments
results show that termhood-based metrics performs better than traditional
frequency-based metrics.","['Sa Liu', 'Chengzhi Zhang']",2013-02-19T00:30:57Z,"['corpus', 'metric', 'comparability', 'based', 'comparable', 'comparable corpus', 'termhood', 'based metric', 'domain', 'language', 'method', 'termhood based', 'building', 'building using', 'comparability metric']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4492v1,Bilingual Terminology Extraction Using Multi-level Termhood,"Purpose: Terminology is the set of technical words or expressions used in
specific contexts, which denotes the core concept in a formal discipline and is
usually applied in the fields of machine translation, information retrieval,
information extraction and text categorization, etc. Bilingual terminology
extraction plays an important role in the application of bilingual dictionary
compilation, bilingual Ontology construction, machine translation and
cross-language information retrieval etc. This paper addresses the issues of
monolingual terminology extraction and bilingual term alignment based on
multi-level termhood.
  Design/methodology/approach: A method based on multi-level termhood is
proposed. The new method computes the termhood of the terminology candidate as
well as the sentence that includes the terminology by the comparison of the
corpus. Since terminologies and general words usually have differently
distribution in the corpus, termhood can also be used to constrain and enhance
the performance of term alignment when aligning bilingual terms on the parallel
corpus. In this paper, bilingual term alignment based on termhood constraints
is presented.
  Findings: Experiment results show multi-level termhood can get better
performance than existing method for terminology extraction. If termhood is
used as constrain factor, the performance of bilingual term alignment can be
improved.","['Chengzhi Zhang', 'Dan Wu']",2013-02-19T00:37:21Z,"['bilingual', 'termhood', 'terminology', 'extraction', 'term', 'alignment', 'bilingual term', 'level', 'level termhood', 'multi', 'multi level', 'term alignment', 'terminology extraction', 'based', 'corpus']"

usually done manually. Methods for inducing frames have been proposed recently,

induction, which incorporates frames, events, participants as latent topics and
learns those frame and event transitions that best explain the text. The number
of frames is inferred by a novel application of a split-merge method from
syntactic parsing. In end-to-end evaluations from text to induced frames and

First, a tagger was trained and tested on word endings only. Subsequent
experiments added back whole-word statistics for the words occurring most

improve, in the limit performing the same as word-based taggers. Surprisingly,
the ending-based tagger initially performed nearly as well as the word-based

word-based tagger. Lastly, and unexpectedly, an effect of negative returns was

Chinese word segmentation such as the sequence tagging can be easily employed

http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5753v3,"A probabilistic framework for analysing the compositionality of
  conceptual combinations","Conceptual combination performs a fundamental role in creating the broad
range of compound phrases utilized in everyday language. This article provides
a novel probabilistic framework for assessing whether the semantics of
conceptual combinations are compositional, and so can be considered as a
function of the semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the
systematicity and productivity of language provide a strong argument in favor
of assuming compositionality, this very assumption is still regularly
questioned in both cognitive science and philosophy. Additionally, the
principle of semantic compositionality is underspecified, which means that
notions of both ""strong"" and ""weak"" compositionality appear in the literature.
Rather than adjudicating between different grades of compositionality, the
framework presented here contributes formal methods for determining a clear
dividing line between compositional and non-compositional semantics. In
addition, we suggest that the distinction between these is contextually
sensitive. Utilizing formal frameworks developed for analyzing composite
systems in quantum theory, we present two methods that allow the semantics of
conceptual combinations to be classified as ""compositional"" or
""non-compositional"". Compositionality is first formalised by factorising the
joint probability distribution modeling the combination, where the terms in the
factorisation correspond to individual concepts. This leads to the necessary
and sufficient condition for the joint probability distribution to exist. A
failure to meet this condition implies that the underlying concepts cannot be
modeled in a single probability space when considering their combination, and
the combination is thus deemed ""non-compositional"". The formal analysis methods
are demonstrated by applying them to an empirical study of twenty-four
non-lexicalised conceptual combinations.","['Peter D. Bruza', 'Kirsty Kitto', 'Brentyn J.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6300v1,Computing Lexical Contrast,"Knowing the degree of semantic contrast between words has widespread
application in natural language processing, including machine translation,
information retrieval, and dialogue systems. Manually-created lexicons focus on
opposites, such as {\rm hot} and {\rm cold}. Opposites are of many kinds such
as antipodals, complementaries, and gradable. However, existing lexicons often
do not classify opposites into the different kinds. They also do not explicitly
list word pairs that are not opposites but yet have some degree of contrast in
meaning, such as {\rm warm} and {\rm cold} or {\rm tropical} and {\rm
freezing}. We propose an automatic method to identify contrasting word pairs
that is based on the hypothesis that if a pair of words, $A$ and $B$, are
contrasting, then there is a pair of opposites, $C$ and $D$, such that $A$ and
$C$ are strongly related and $B$ and $D$ are strongly related. (For example,
there exists the pair of opposites {\rm hot} and {\rm cold} such that {\rm
tropical} is related to {\rm hot,} and {\rm freezing} is related to {\rm
cold}.) We will call this the contrast hypothesis. We begin with a large
crowdsourcing experiment to determine the amount of human agreement on the
concept of oppositeness and its different kinds. In the process, we flesh out
key features of different kinds of opposites. We then present an automatic and
empirical measure of lexical contrast that relies on the contrast hypothesis,
corpus statistics, and the structure of a {\it Roget}-like thesaurus. We show
that the proposed measure of lexical contrast obtains high precision and large
coverage, outperforming existing methods.","['Saif M. Mohammad', 'Bonnie J. Dorr', 'Graeme Hirst', 'Peter D.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0575v2,Development of Marathi Part of Speech Tagger Using Statistical Approach,"Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a process of assigning the words in a text
corresponding to a particular part of speech. A fundamental version of POS
tagging is the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. For
processing natural languages, Part of Speech tagging is a prominent tool. It is
one of the simplest as well as most constant and statistical model for many NLP
applications. POS Tagging is an initial stage of linguistics, text analysis
like information retrieval, machine translator, text to speech synthesis,
information extraction etc. In POS Tagging we assign a Part of Speech tag to
each word in a sentence and literature. Various approaches have been proposed
to implement POS taggers. In this paper we present a Marathi part of speech
tagger. It is morphologically rich language. Marathi is spoken by the native
people of Maharashtra. The general approach used for development of tagger is
statistical using Unigram, Bigram, Trigram and HMM Methods. It presents a clear
idea about all the algorithms with suitable examples. It also introduces a tag
set for Marathi which can be used for tagging Marathi text. In this paper we
have shown the development of the tagger as well as compared to check the
accuracy of taggers output. The three Marathi POS taggers viz. Unigram, Bigram,

relationships between words and phrases in NLP. By overcoming data sparsity
problems, as well as providing information about semantic relatedness which is
not available in discrete representations, distributed representations have
proven useful in many NLP tasks. Recent work has shown how compositional
semantic representations can successfully be applied to a number of monolingual
applications such as sentiment analysis. At the same time, there has been some
initial success in work on learning shared word-level representations across
languages. We combine these two approaches by proposing a method for learning
distributed representations in a multilingual setup. Our model learns to assign
similar embeddings to aligned sentences and dissimilar ones to sentence which
are not aligned while not requiring word alignments. We show that our
representations are semantically informative and apply them to a cross-lingual
document classification task where we outperform the previous state of the art.
Further, by employing parallel corpora of multiple language pairs we find that
our model learns representations that capture semantic relationships across
languages for which no parallel data was used.","['Karl Moritz Hermann', 'Phil Blunsom']",2013-12-20T23:13:38Z,"['representation', 'distributed', 'distributed representation', 'word', 'language', 'semantic', 'across', 'across language', 'aligned', 'alignment', 'data', 'learning', 'learns', 'model', 'model learns']"

syntax of SL appears very specific as it uses massively the multiplicity of
articulators and its access to the spatial dimensions. Therefore new parsing
techniques are developed. However these need to be evaluated. The shortage on

methods for information retrieval and natural language modeling. Here we
explore its application to semantic similarity. By finding shared ontology
terms, semantic similarity can be established between annotated genes. A common
procedure for establishing semantic similarity is to calculate the
descriptiveness (information content) of ontology terms and use these values to
determine the similarity of annotations. Most often information content is
calculated for an ontology term by analyzing its frequency in an annotation
corpus. The inherent problems in using these values to model functional
similarity motivates our work. Summary: We present a novel calculation for

alternative method for establishing the information content of its terms. We

  intensity and emotional content","Conjuring up our thoughts, language reflects statistical patterns of word
co-occurrences which in turn come to describe how we perceive the world.
Whether counting how frequently nouns and verbs combine in Google search
queries, or extracting eigenvectors from term document matrices made up of
Wikipedia lines and Shakespeare plots, the resulting latent semantics capture
not only the associative links which form concepts, but also spatial dimensions
embedded within the surface structure of language. As both the shape and
movements of objects have been found to be associated with phonetic contrasts
already in toddlers, this study explores whether articulatory and acoustic
parameters may likewise differentiate the latent semantics of action verbs.
Selecting 3 x 20 emotion, face, and hand related verbs known to activate
premotor areas in the brain, their mutual cosine similarities were computed
using latent semantic analysis LSA, and the resulting adjacency matrices were
compared based on two different large scale text corpora; HAWIK and TASA.
Applying hierarchical clustering to identify common structures across the two
text corpora, the verbs largely divide into combined mouth and hand movements
versus emotional expressions. Transforming the verbs into their constituent
phonemes, the clustered small and large size movements appear differentiated by
front versus back vowels corresponding to increasing levels of arousal. Whereas
the clustered emotional verbs seem characterized by sequences of close versus
open jaw produced phonemes, generating up- or downwards shifts in formant
frequencies that may influence their perceived valence. Suggesting, that the
latent semantics of action verbs reflect parameters of intensity and emotional
polarity that appear correlated with the articulatory contrasts and acoustic
characteristics of phonemes",['Michael Kai Petersen'],2014-05-06T16:52:34Z,"['verb', 'latent', 'emotional', 'latent semantics', 'semantics', 'action', 'action verb', 'movement', 'parameter', 'phoneme', 'semantics action', 'versus', 'acoustic', 'appear', 'articulatory']"

Though conceptually simple and easy to understand, the mention-pair model is

sophistication. Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to
improve the mention-pair model, one by acquiring the mention-ranking model to
rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training the

with a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference
resolution, which combines the strengths of the mention-ranking model and the
entity-mention model, and is therefore theoretically more appealing than both
of these models. In addition, we seek to improve cluster rankers via two
extensions: (1) lexicalization and (2) incorporating knowledge of anaphoricity

http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0032v1,Comparing and Combining Sentiment Analysis Methods,"Several messages express opinions about events, products, and services,
political views or even their author's emotional state and mood. Sentiment
analysis has been used in several applications including analysis of the
repercussions of events in social networks, analysis of opinions about products
and services, and simply to better understand aspects of social communication
in Online Social Networks (OSNs). There are multiple methods for measuring
sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning
methods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some methods, it is unclear
which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or
negative) of a message as the current literature does not provide a method of
comparison among existing methods. Such a comparison is crucial for
understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of
popular methods in analyzing the content of OSNs messages. Our study aims at
filling this gap by presenting comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis
methods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is
identified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are
in tune with ground truth). We develop a new method that combines existing
approaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement. We
also present a free Web service called iFeel, which provides an open API for

only the small set of basis words. We first construct a cost function and show
that the minimization of the cost function results in a basis. We derive
conditions for convergence of this cost function and validate them
experimentally on a very large proper name database. Experiments show the
transcription can be achieved by transcribing a set of small number of basis

performance is better if the proper names have same origin, namely, same

Grammatical Framework (GF) application grammar development. An important
component of GF is its Resource Grammar Library (RGL) that encapsulates the
low-level linguistic knowledge about morphology and syntax of currently more
than 20 languages facilitating rapid development of multilingual applications.
In the ideal case, porting a GF application grammar to a new language would
only require introducing the domain lexicon - translation equivalents that are
interlinked via common abstract terms. While it is possible for a highly
restricted CNL, developing and porting a less restricted CNL requires above
average linguistic knowledge about the particular language, and above average
GF experience. Specifying a lexicon is mostly straightforward in the case of
nouns (incl. multi-word units), however, verbs are the most complex category
(in terms of both inflectional paradigms and argument structure), and adding
them to a GF application grammar is not a straightforward task. In this paper
we are focusing on verbs, investigating the possibility of creating a
multilingual FrameNet-based GF library. We propose an extension to the current
RGL, allowing GF application developers to define clauses on the semantic
level, thus leaving the language-specific syntactic mapping to this extension.

  abstracts","Identifying concepts and relationships in biomedical text enables knowledge
to be applied in computational analyses. Many biological natural language
process (BioNLP) projects attempt to address this challenge, but the state of
the art in BioNLP still leaves much room for improvement. Progress in BioNLP
research depends on large, annotated corpora for evaluating information
extraction systems and training machine learning models. Traditionally, such
corpora are created by small numbers of expert annotators often working over
extended periods of time. Recent studies have shown that workers on microtask
crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) can, in
aggregate, generate high-quality annotations of biomedical text. Here, we
investigated the use of the AMT in capturing disease mentions in PubMed
abstracts. We used the NCBI Disease corpus as a gold standard for refining and
benchmarking our crowdsourcing protocol. After several iterations, we arrived
at a protocol that reproduced the annotations of the 593 documents in the
training set of this gold standard with an overall F measure of 0.872
(precision 0.862, recall 0.883). The output can also be tuned to optimize for
precision (max = 0.984 when recall = 0.269) or recall (max = 0.980 when
precision = 0.436). Each document was examined by 15 workers, and their
annotations were merged based on a simple voting method. In total 145 workers
combined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06
per abstract per worker. The quality of the annotations, as judged with the F
measure, increases with the number of workers assigned to each task such that
the system can be tuned to balance cost against quality. These results
demonstrate that microtask crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for generating
well-annotated corpora in BioNLP.","['Benjamin M Good', 'Max Nanis', 'Andrew I.

constrained. As we demonstrate in this paper, merely discriminating between the
intended word and a random close variation of it within the context of a
sentence is a task that can be performed with high accuracy using
straightforward models. Trigram models are sufficient in almost all cases. The
difficulty comes when every word in the sentence is a potential error, with a
large set of possible candidate corrections. Despite their strengths, trigram
models cannot reliably find true errors without introducing many more, at least
not when used in the obvious sequential way without added structure. The
detection task exposes weakness not visible in the selection task.","[""L.

  Estimation","We present SimLex-999, a gold standard resource for evaluating distributional
semantic models that improves on existing resources in several important ways.
First, in contrast to gold standards such as WordSim-353 and MEN, it explicitly
quantifies similarity rather than association or relatedness, so that pairs of
entities that are associated but not actually similar [Freud, psychology] have
a low rating. We show that, via this focus on similarity, SimLex-999
incentivizes the development of models with a different, and arguably wider
range of applications than those which reflect conceptual association. Second,
SimLex-999 contains a range of concrete and abstract adjective, noun and verb
pairs, together with an independent rating of concreteness and (free)
association strength for each pair. This diversity enables fine-grained
analyses of the performance of models on concepts of different types, and
consequently greater insight into how architectures can be improved. Further,
unlike existing gold standard evaluations, for which automatic approaches have
reached or surpassed the inter-annotator agreement ceiling, state-of-the-art
models perform well below this ceiling on SimLex-999. There is therefore plenty
of scope for SimLex-999 to quantify future improvements to distributional

  Translation System using Source-Side Pre-Processing","Machine Translation is one of the major oldest and the most active research
area in Natural Language Processing. Currently, Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) dominates the Machine Translation research. Statistical Machine
Translation is an approach to Machine Translation which uses models to learn
translation patterns directly from data, and generalize them to translate a new
unseen text. The SMT approach is largely language independent, i.e. the models
can be applied to any language pair. Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
attempts to generate translations using statistical methods based on bilingual
text corpora. Where such corpora are available, excellent results can be
attained translating similar texts, but such corpora are still not available
for many language pairs. Statistical Machine Translation systems, in general,
have difficulty in handling the morphology on the source or the target side
especially for morphologically rich languages. Errors in morphology or syntax
in the target language can have severe consequences on meaning of the sentence.
They change the grammatical function of words or the understanding of the
sentence through the incorrect tense information in verb. Baseline SMT also
known as Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) system does not
use any linguistic information and it only operates on surface word form.
Recent researches shown that adding linguistic information helps to improve the
accuracy of the translation with less amount of bilingual corpora. Adding
linguistic information can be done using the Factored Statistical Machine
Translation system through pre-processing steps. This paper investigates about

The paper also proposes a methodology for generating a stopword list from the
prepared corpora. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of removing
stopwords on the SA task. The problem is that the stopwords lists generated
before were on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is not the common language
used in OSN. We have generated a stopword list of Egyptian dialect and a
corpus-based list to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare the efficiency of
text classification when using the generated lists along with previously
generated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with the MSA
list. The text classification was performed using Na\""ive Bayes and Decision
Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigrams and bigram. The
experiments show that the general lists containing the Egyptian dialects words
give better performance than using lists of MSA stopwords only.","['Walaa Medhat', 'Ahmed H.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2082v2,Contrastive Unsupervised Word Alignment with Non-Local Features,"Word alignment is an important natural language processing task that
indicates the correspondence between natural languages. Recently, unsupervised
learning of log-linear models for word alignment has received considerable
attention as it combines the merits of generative and discriminative
approaches. However, a major challenge still remains: it is intractable to
calculate the expectations of non-local features that are critical for
capturing the divergence between natural languages. We propose a contrastive
approach that aims to differentiate observed training examples from noises. It
not only introduces prior knowledge to guide unsupervised learning but also
cancels out partition functions. Based on the observation that the probability
mass of log-linear models for word alignment is usually highly concentrated, we
propose to use top-n alignments to approximate the expectations with respect to
posterior distributions. This allows for efficient and accurate calculation of
expectations of non-local features. Experiments show that our approach achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised word alignment
methods.","['Yang Liu', 'Maosong Sun']",2014-10-08T12:24:38Z,"['alignment', 'word', 'word alignment', 'unsupervised', 'approach', 'expectation', 'feature', 'language', 'local', 'local feature', 'natural', 'natural language', 'non', 'non local', 'contrastive']"

satisfy a certain pattern. Second, linguistics has shown that idiomatic pairs
of words often appear together more frequently than chance. For example, in the

morphological analysis of the text words is performed using the open source
morphological Analyzer AlKhalil Morpho Sys. Outputs for each word analyzed out
of context, are its different possible vowelizations. The integration of this
Analyzer in our vowelization system required the addition of a lexical database
containing the most frequent words in Arabic language. Using a statistical
approach based on two hidden Markov models (HMM), the second module aims to
eliminate the ambiguities. Indeed, for the first HMM, the unvowelized Arabic
words are the observed states and the vowelized words are the hidden states.
The observed states of the second HMM are identical to those of the first, but
the hidden states are the lists of possible diacritics of the word without its
Arabic letters. Our system uses Viterbi algorithm to select the optimal path
among the solutions proposed by Al Khalil Morpho Sys. Our approach opens an
important way to improve the performance of automatic vowelization of Arabic

Language Processing (NLP). A lot of research has been devoted to finding ways

Distributional approaches --- meaning distributed representations that exploit
co-occurrence statistics of large corpora --- have proved popular and
successful across a number of tasks. However, natural language usually comes in
structures beyond the word level, with meaning arising not only from the
individual words but also the structure they are contained in at the phrasal or
sentential level. Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of
an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is an equally fundamental
task of NLP.
  This dissertation explores methods for learning distributed semantic
representations and models for composing these into representations for larger
linguistic units. Our underlying hypothesis is that neural models are a
suitable vehicle for learning semantically rich representations and that such
representations in turn are suitable vehicles for solving important tasks in
natural language processing. The contribution of this thesis is a thorough

  lexicographic inquiry with NooJ","In the following article we elected to study with NooJ the lexis of a 17 th
century text, Mary Astell's seminal essay, A Serious Proposal to the Ladies,
part I, published in 1694. We first focused on the semantics to see how Astell
builds her vindication of the female sex, which words she uses to sensitise
women to their alienated condition and promote their education. Then we studied
the morphology of the lexemes (which is different from contemporary English)
used by the author, thanks to the NooJ tools we have devised for this purpose.
NooJ has great functionalities for lexicographic work. Its commands and graphs
prove to be most efficient in the spotting of archaic words or variants in
spelling. Introduction In our previous articles, we have studied the
singularities of 17 th century English within the framework of a diachronic
analysis thanks to syntactical and morphological graphs and thanks to the
dictionaries we have compiled from a corpus that may be expanded overtime. Our
early work was based on a limited corpus of English travel literature to Greece
in the 17 th century. This article deals with a late seventeenth century text
written by a woman philosopher and essayist, Mary Astell (1666--1731),
considered as one of the first English feminists. Astell wrote her essay at a
time in English history when women were ""the weaker vessel"" and their main
business in life was to charm and please men by their looks and submissiveness.
In this essay we will see how NooJ can help us analyse Astell's rhetoric (what
point of view does she adopt, does she speak in her own name, in the name of
all women, what is her representation of men and women and their relationships
in the text, what are the goals of education?). Then we will turn our attention
to the morphology of words in the text and use NooJ commands and graphs to
carry out a lexicographic inquiry into Astell's lexemes.","['Hélène Pignot', 'Odile Piton']",2014-12-03T07:16:04Z,"['astell', 'nooj', 'english', 'woman', 'century', 'text', 'word', 'article', 'essay', 'graph', 'lexicographic', 'mary', 'mary astell', 'thanks', 'century text']"

whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are
empirically found to outperform the baseline models with a small vocabulary as
well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models. Furthermore, when we

expect some of the attributes of one of the words to be inherited by the other.
Motivated by this close connection between attributes and relations, given a

behavior and on building an inventory of multilingual lexica of discourse
markers. This work describes new methods and approaches for the description,
classification, and annotation of discourse markers in the specific domain of
the Europarl corpus. The study of discourse markers in the context of
translation is crucial due to the idiomatic nature of these structures.
Multilingual lexica together with the functional analysis of such structures
are useful tools for the hard task of translating discourse markers into
possible equivalents from one language to another. Using Daniel Marcu's
validated discourse markers for English, extracted from the Brown Corpus, our
purpose is to build multilingual lexica of discourse markers for other
languages, based on machine translation techniques. The major assumption in
this study is that the usage of a discourse marker is independent of the
language, i.e., the rhetorical function of a discourse marker in a sentence in
one language is equivalent to the rhetorical function of the same discourse
marker in another language.","['António Lopes', 'David Martins de Matos', 'Vera Cabarrão', 'Ricardo Ribeiro', 'Helena Moniz', 'Isabel Trancoso', 'Ana Isabel Mata']",2015-03-31T17:56:07Z,"['discourse', 'discourse marker', 'marker', 'language', 'lexica', 'multilingual', 'multilingual lexica', 'lexica discourse', 'translation', 'another', 'corpus', 'equivalent', 'event', 'function', 'function discourse']"

success story of recent NLP research. However, developing models that learn
useful representations of phrases and sentences has proved far harder. We

definitions. We present two applications of these architectures: ""reverse

neural language embedding models trained on definitions from a handful of
freely-available lexical resources perform as well or better than existing

important problem. With the advent of BPO's in recent times, specifically those

that the studied metrics do not correlate with other traditional network

of the symmetry measurements was verified in the authorship attribution task.
Interestingly, we found that specific authors prefer particular types of
symmetric motifs. As a consequence, the authorship of books could be accurately

form a constituent in the data which is one of the limitations of our approach.
  We study the effect of collapsing training and test data. A parsing effect
can be obtained if collapsed data help the parser in its decisions and a
training effect can be obtained if training on the collapsed data improves
results. We also collapse the gold standard and show that our model
significantly outperforms the baseline model on our gold standard, which
indicates that there is a training effect. We show that the baseline model
performs significantly better on our gold standard when the data are collapsed

that there is a parsing effect. We show that these results can lead to improved

http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04891v2,"Learning Better Word Embedding by Asymmetric Low-Rank Projection of
  Knowledge Graph","Word embedding, which refers to low-dimensional dense vector representations
of natural words, has demonstrated its power in many natural language
processing tasks. However, it may suffer from the inaccurate and incomplete
information contained in the free text corpus as training data. To tackle this
challenge, there have been quite a few works that leverage knowledge graphs as
an additional information source to improve the quality of word embedding.
Although these works have achieved certain success, they have neglected some
important facts about knowledge graphs: (i) many relationships in knowledge
graphs are \emph{many-to-one}, \emph{one-to-many} or even \emph{many-to-many},
rather than simply \emph{one-to-one}; (ii) most head entities and tail entities
in knowledge graphs come from very different semantic spaces. To address these
issues, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm named ProjectNet. ProjecNet
models the relationships between head and tail entities after transforming them
with different low-rank projection matrices. The low-rank projection can allow
non \emph{one-to-one} relationships between entities, while different
projection matrices for head and tail entities allow them to originate in
different semantic spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that ProjectNet
yields more accurate word embedding than previous works, thus leads to clear
improvements in various natural language processing tasks.","['Fei Tian', 'Bin Gao', 'Enhong Chen', 'Tie-Yan Liu']",2015-05-19T07:08:10Z,"['many', 'one', 'emph', 'entity', 'graph', 'knowledge', 'knowledge graph', 'word', 'different', 'embedding', 'low', 'projection', 'word embedding', 'emph one', 'head']"

Our approach is based on the CharWNN deep neural network, which uses word-level

texts in Portuguese; and the SPA CoNLL-2002 corpus, which contains texts in
Spanish. Our experimental results shade light on the contribution of neural
character embeddings for NER. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same neural
network which has been successfully applied to POS tagging can also achieve
state-of-the-art results for language-independet NER, using the same
hyperparameters, and without any handcrafted features. For the HAREM I corpus,
CharWNN outperforms the state-of-the-art system by 7.9 points in the F1-score

http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06816v5,"Representing Meaning with a Combination of Logical and Distributional
  Models","NLP tasks differ in the semantic information they require, and at this time
no single se- mantic representation fulfills all requirements. Logic-based
representations characterize sentence structure, but do not capture the graded
aspect of meaning. Distributional models give graded similarity ratings for
words and phrases, but do not capture sentence structure in the same detail as
logic-based approaches. So it has been argued that the two are complementary.
We adopt a hybrid approach that combines logic-based and distributional
semantics through probabilistic logic inference in Markov Logic Networks
(MLNs). In this paper, we focus on the three components of a practical system
integrating logical and distributional models: 1) Parsing and task
representation is the logic-based part where input problems are represented in
probabilistic logic. This is quite different from representing them in standard
first-order logic. 2) For knowledge base construction we form weighted
inference rules. We integrate and compare distributional information with other
sources, notably WordNet and an existing paraphrase collection. In particular,
we use our system to evaluate distributional lexical entailment approaches. We
use a variant of Robinson resolution to determine the necessary inference
rules. More sources can easily be added by mapping them to logical rules; our
system learns a resource-specific weight that corrects for scaling differences
between resources. 3) In discussing probabilistic inference, we show how to
solve the inference problems efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we use the
task of textual entailment (RTE), which can utilize the strengths of both
logic-based and distributional representations. In particular we focus on the
SICK dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results.","['I. Beltagy', 'Stephen Roller', 'Pengxiang Cheng', 'Katrin Erk', 'Raymond J.

these systems, but it still not desired performance, especially for
morphologically-Rich Language (MRL) such as Arabic, due to the complexities and
challenges exist in the nature of the languages itself. One of these challenges
is the detection of idioms or proverbs phrases within the writer text or
comment. An idiom or proverb is a form of speech or an expression that is
peculiar to itself. Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual
meanings of its elements and can yield different sentiment when treats as
separate words. Consequently, In order to facilitate the task of detection and
classification of lexical phrases for automated SA systems, this paper presents
AIPSeLEX a novel idioms/ proverbs sentiment lexicon for modern standard Arabic
(MSA) and colloquial. AIPSeLEX is manually collected and annotated at sentence
level with semantic orientation (positive or negative). The efforts of manually
building and annotating the lexicon are reported. Moreover, we build a
classifier that extracts idioms and proverbs, phrases from text using n-gram
and similarity measure methods. Finally, several experiments were carried out
on various data, including Arabic tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel
reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments) from publicly available
Arabic online reviews websites (social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce web
sites) to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of AIPSeLEX.","['Hossam S. Ibrahim', 'Sherif M.

theories of lexical semantics. The former are dense and uninterpretable, the
latter largely based on familiar, discrete classes (e.g., supersenses) and

representations are more similar to the interpretable features typically used
in NLP, though they are discovered automatically from raw corpora. Because the

tasks.","['Manaal Faruqui', 'Yulia Tsvetkov', 'Dani Yogatama', 'Chris Dyer', 'Noah Smith']",2015-06-05T18:20:43Z,"['vector', 'representation', 'sparse', 'word', 'word vector', 'automatically', 'automatically raw', 'based', 'based familiar', 'benchmark', 'benchmark task', 'binary', 'binary vector', 'class', 'class supersenses']"

analysis. From a practical view-point, MagiCoder radically reduces the revision
time of ADR reports: the pharmacologist has simply to revise and validate the
automatic solution versus the hard task of choosing solutions in the 70k terms
of MedDRA. This improvement of the expert work efficiency has a meaningful
impact on the quality of data analysis. Moreover, our procedure is general
purpose. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language, but
preliminarily analyses show that it is robust to language and dictionary
changes.","['Carlo Combi', 'Riccardo Lora', 'Ugo Moretti', 'Marco Pagliarini', 'Margherita Zorzi']",2015-06-26T13:17:31Z,"['adr', 'analysis', 'encoding', 'magicoder', 'meddra', 'pharmacovigilance', 'adr description', 'adrs', 'description', 'drug', 'expert', 'free', 'free text', 'language', 'report']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09107v2,A complex network approach to stylometry,"Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental
properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical
systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large
amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a
limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying
physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language
processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex
networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current
statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the
topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual
description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches
outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods
were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here
could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the
topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.",['Diego R.

Italian Natural language Applications) a manually annotated prior polarity
lexical resource for Italian natural language applications in the field of
opinion mining and sentiment induction. The resource consists in two different
sets, an Italian dictionary of more than 277.000 words tagged with their prior
polarity value, and a set of polarity modifiers, containing more than 200
words, which can be used in combination with non neutral terms of the
dictionary in order to induce the sentiment of Italian compound terms. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first prior polarity manually annotated
resource which has been developed for the Italian natural language.","['Valeria Borzì', 'Simone Faro', 'Arianna Pavone', 'Sabrina Sansone']",2015-07-01T07:29:12Z,"['italian', 'polarity', 'resource', 'language', 'prior', 'prior polarity', 'italian natural', 'natural', 'natural language', 'resource italian', 'sentiment', 'annotated', 'application', 'dictionary', 'language application']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00639v1,"Simple, Fast Semantic Parsing with a Tensor Kernel","We describe a simple approach to semantic parsing based on a tensor product
kernel. We extract two feature vectors: one for the query and one for each
candidate logical form. We then train a classifier using the tensor product of
the two vectors. Using very simple features for both, our system achieves an
average F1 score of 40.1% on the WebQuestions dataset. This is comparable to
more complex systems but is simpler to implement and runs faster.",['Daoud Clarke'],2015-07-02T15:58:25Z,"['simple', 'tensor', 'feature', 'kernel', 'one', 'parsing', 'product', 'semantic', 'semantic parsing', 'system', 'tensor product', 'two', 'using', 'vector', 'achieves']"

does not need an additional training corpus. The synset/lexeme embeddings
obtained live in the same vector space as the word embeddings. A sparse tensor
formalization guarantees efficiency and parallelizability. We use WordNet as a
lexical resource, but AutoExtend can be easily applied to other resources like
Freebase. AutoExtend achieves state-of-the-art performance on word similarity

  Analysis in R","We consider a large number of text data sets. These are cooking recipes. Term
distribution and other distributional properties of the data are investigated.
Our aim is to look at various analytical approaches which allow for mining of
information on both high and low detail scales. Metric space embedding is
fundamental to our interest in the semantic properties of this data. We
consider the projection of all data into analyses of aggregated versions of the
data. We contrast that with projection of aggregated versions of the data into
analyses of all the data. Analogously for the term set, we look at analysis of
selected terms. We also look at inherent term associations such as between
singular and plural. In addition to our use of Correspondence Analysis in R,
for latent semantic space mapping, we also use Apache Solr. Setting up the Solr
server and carrying out querying is described. A further novelty is that
querying is supported in Solr based on the principal factor plane mapping of
all the data. This uses a bounding box query, based on factor projections.",['Fionn Murtagh'],2015-07-06T16:32:52Z,"['data', 'analysis', 'solr', 'term', 'correspondence', 'factor', 'look', 'projection', 'set', 'aggregated', 'aggregated version', 'also', 'apache', 'apache solr', 'based']"

helping bridge the gap between psychology / cognitive science and computational
approaches in sentiment/opinion analysis literature. We focus on the opinion
holder's underlying needs and their resultant goals, which, in a utilitarian
model of sentiment, provides the basis for explaining the reason a sentiment
valence is held. While these thoughts are still immature, scattered,
unstructured, and even imaginary, we believe that these perspectives might
suggest fruitful avenues for various kinds of future work.","['Jiwei Li', 'Eduard Hovy']",2015-07-06T22:25:55Z,"['sentiment', 'opinion', 'analysis', 'opinion analysis', 'sentiment opinion', 'analysis literature', 'analysis paper', 'approach', 'approach sentiment', 'avenue', 'avenue various', 'basis', 'basis explaining', 'believe', 'believe perspective']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01701v1,A Survey and Classification of Controlled Natural Languages,"What is here called controlled natural language (CNL) has traditionally been
given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide
variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve
communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and
intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent
differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same
umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification
scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs
is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today.
Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered
cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on
the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The
goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for
CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a
starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers
to make design decisions.",['Tobias Kuhn'],2015-07-07T08:23:31Z,"['language', 'natural', 'classification', 'natural language', 'provide', 'cnl', 'common', 'controlled', 'controlled natural', 'english', 'formal', 'general', 'given', 'improve', 'survey']"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02012v1,Hindi to English Transfer Based Machine Translation System,"In large societies like India there is a huge demand to convert one human
language into another. Lots of work has been done in this area. Many transfer
based MTS have developed for English to other languages, as MANTRA CDAC Pune,
MATRA CDAC Pune, SHAKTI IISc Bangalore and IIIT Hyderabad. Still there is a
little work done for Hindi to other languages. Currently we are working on it.
In this paper we focus on designing a system, that translate the document from
Hindi to English by using transfer based approach. This system takes an input
text check its structure through parsing. Reordering rules are used to generate
the text in target language. It is better than Corpus Based MTS because Corpus
Based MTS require large amount of word aligned data for translation that is not
available for many languages while Transfer Based MTS requires only knowledge
of both the languages(source language and target language) to make transfer
rules. We get correct translation for simple assertive sentences and almost
correct for complex and compound sentences.","['Akanksha Gehlot', 'Vaishali Sharma', 'Shashi Pal Singh', 'Ajai Kumar']",2015-07-08T03:50:47Z,"['language', 'based', 'transfer', 'transfer based', 'english', 'hindi', 'system', 'translation', 'cdac', 'cdac pune', 'corpus', 'corpus based', 'correct', 'done', 'hindi english']"
